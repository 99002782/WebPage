     <h2>SPA</h2>
     <img src="../content/spa.jpg" width="100%"/>
     <pre>
        Treatments typically offered in day spas include massages; facials 
        and makeup application; 
        electrolysis; spa manicures and pedicures;
         body treatments like exfoliation, wraps and packs; aromatherapy;
          and hair services like cutting, styling and coloring.
          Historically, many spas were developed where natural hot springs or healing mineral waters already existed.
           Hotels were built and people came to for the health benefits a good soak or "taking the waters" would provide.
            The facilities provided spa services, activities, health-related dining, 
          all with a focus on the benefits of the natural setting.

     <h2>Food Service</h2>
     <img src="../content/food.jpg" width="100%"/>
     <pre>
        Hot and cold dishes available at breakfast: fruits, cold meat, cheese, cereal, yogurts 
        - as well as such expected hot foods as eggs, bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausages (western expectations). 
        Plenty of bread varieties and fresh pastries. Fruit juices, tea, coffee.
        Lunch menu a little disappointing: mostly sandwiches, burgers, salads.
        A good time to go and eat in the village of Franschhoek.
        Dinner (at Dish Restaurant) is well served and of high class. 
        Meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Nothing particularly exciting, but all extremely well cooked, 
        flavoured and presented. Such ingredients as Cape salmon, calamari, chicken, duck, lamb (which I found vey good), 
        steaks; pasta, vegetables. Various desserts.
        A good wine list (of South African wines) with a wide range of wines by the glass.
